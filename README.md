# Gamefolio: Pixel RPG Portfolio

**Status:** Work in Progress (as of 31st May, 10PM)  
**Author:** Anushree Umak

This is an interactive pixel-art RPG portfolio project, built using Phaser and custom-designed assets. It merges storytelling, game development, and technical design to create a walkable "world" where different houses and rooms represent different aspects of my background and skills.  

Originally started as a creative experiment, it has now become a personal showcase I plan to link in internship applications. The project is still evolving, with key features currently in progress.

## Project Overview

Gamefolio is structured like a small game world. The user controls a character who can explore a map, interact with objects, and eventually enter themed rooms. Each room will represent a section of my portfolio: research, projects, creative tools, and personal story.  

The final version will let viewers explore each house to learn about my experience, achievements, and side projects. Currently, only one room is working as a prototype — the others are under construction.

## Current Features

- Character movement using keyboard arrow keys  
- Custom Tiled map integration with Phaser 3  
- Animated sprite for player character  
- Collision detection with environment (walkable vs non-walkable areas)  
- Pixel-based map design with layered tilesets  
- Background music with mute toggle  
- Dark mode visual palette  
- One functional house interior  
- Scene management for world and room transitions  
- Walkable world based on grass and dirt paths  
- Scaled to fit screen resolutions for a clean retro aesthetic

## Under Construction

- Additional rooms representing:
  - AI and academic research work  
  - Backend systems and automation tools  
  - UI/UX design and creative side projects  
- Dialogue overlays for in-game explanations  
- Interactive puzzle or hidden feature (e.g., unlockable compliment or note)  
- Transitions between world and interior rooms  
- Website integration (React) for smoother portfolio navigation  
- UI indicators for navigation and room states  
- Optimization for smoother transitions and edge cases

## Tools and Technologies

- Phaser 3 (JavaScript game engine)  
- Tiled (map and tile editor)  
- JavaScript (ES6)  
- HTML/CSS  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Figma (UI/scene planning)  
- Git + GitHub (version control)  

Planned extensions include React integration and embedded portfolio site layout for broader deployment.

## Goals and Motivation

This project started as a fun way to explore pixel art and game development but quickly turned into a long-term portfolio concept. The goal is to offer a more engaging, memorable way for recruiters or collaborators to explore my work.

By building this gamefolio, I demonstrate:
- Independent learning of game frameworks like Phaser  
- Asset management and licensing discipline  
- Design thinking through environment layouts and scene flow  
- Creative presentation of technical content  
- The ability to plan and manage large side projects with evolving goals

## Known Limitations

- Only one room is currently working; others display “Under Construction” states  
- No mobile responsiveness implemented yet  
- Transitions between maps are functional but will be polished further  
- No menu or pause features yet  
- Character pathfinding is manual and grid-based

## Final Notes

Gamefolio is a personal, ongoing side project aimed at creatively expressing who I am — as a developer, designer, and learner. While it is still in development, it reflects a blend of skills that are important to me: technical depth, creativity, and storytelling.  

This repository will be updated as new houses are completed and features are added. All feedback is welcome.
